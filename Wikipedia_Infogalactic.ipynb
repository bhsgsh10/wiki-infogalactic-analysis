A co-founder and two freelancers resigned in protest of the coverage. Gavin McInnes, founder of the far-right neo-fascist organization Proud Boys, is also a contributor.

On 17 February 2016, the government admitted that it made a mistake and said that it would allow The Rebel Media correspondents into press briefings. The Canadian Association of Journalists President Nick Taylor-Vaisey said \"Albertans should be choosing what coverage of their government they want to read, not seeing government try to choose what coverage is suitable for Albertans.\"</span></div></body></br>"

The main difference, however, is evident in the part where the Wikipwdia entry brings up an NYT accusation that Daily Caller *'published articles espousing white nationalist, racist anti-black and antisemitic views under a pseudonym in white supremacist publications.'* This part is entirely absent from the Infogalactic entry.\n",
