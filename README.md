# Analysis of Wikipedia and Infogalactic articles
This python notebook looks at how articles on Wikipedia and Infogalactic differ in text when it comes to describing alt-right media outlets. While Wikipedia articles are usually more forthright in calling out websites and channels that have reported lies or have spread misinformation, articles on the same media entities on Infogalactic tend to avoid mentioning those facts. More specific findings are included in the python notebook.

This analysis was originally done in Fall 2019 as part of Prof. Mark Hansen's computational journalism class at Columbia Journalism School.
